# Irisflowerp1

This is the first project out of 30 projects i made to practice and learn machine learning 
from scratch to advanced . 

i already know basics of machine learning , so there is not to much to learn in 
iris flower classification . just brushed up my previous topics like 
-> labelencoding
->standardscaler
->Train_test_split
->fitting a model 
->Evaluating Accuracy 

Accuracy of train data = 0.958
Accuracy of test data = 0.93333
